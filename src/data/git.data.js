        `Git is a distributed version control system that tracks versions of files. It is often used to control source code by programmers collaboratively developing software.
        Design goals of Git include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows â€“ thousands of parallel branches running on different computers.
        Git was created in 2005 for use in the development of the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds and others developing the kernel.
        It was originally only used for the linux kernel and git itself, but was quickly adopted by other developers.
        Now it is used by almost 95% of developers around the world, and has resulted in the creation of multiple successful companies, like GitHub, GitLab and SourceForge.`,

        The ${code("commit")} command basically is used to log your changes in your code. <br> <br>
        Of course, ${code("commit")} also has an basic syntax. Almost everyone uses <q>-m</q>, an abbreviation for message. <br>
